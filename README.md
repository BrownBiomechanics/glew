What is this project ?
----------------------

This project is **NOT** the official glew repository.

It is a fork of glew sources hosted at https://github.com/nigels-com/glew

It is used as staging area to maintain topics specific to BrownBiomechanics projects like Autoscoper that will eventually be contributed back to the official repository.

What is the branch naming convention ?
--------------------------------------

Each branch is named following the pattern `brownbiomechanics[-vX.Y.Z]-YYYY-MM-DD-SHA{N}`

where:

* `brownbiomechanics` is the name of the custom application or extension.
* `vX.Y.Z` is the version of forked project
* `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date of the last official commit associated with the branch.
* `SHA{N}` are the first N characters of the last official commit associated with the branch.
